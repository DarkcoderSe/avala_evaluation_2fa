Thank you so much for giving me opportunity to solve this problem. I never
ever had enjoyed so much while solving this. 
The approach of this problem is to obviosly hexspeaks for which I have used 
the dictionary of I33t which not only includes ABCDEF but also includes 0 as O, 
9 is G, and 1 as I and L, etc. Along with it, I have filtered it through finding linear patterns
such as 123456 or 87654321 that fulfill the y = mx+c general equation. 
Also, passed through test in which it can be checked that whether identical 
characters are repeating or not such as 1212128A, and ABCABC32, and 4A014A01. 

You have to run file along with the data.json which is preprocessed. 

I hope you will like me solution. :)
